# cbsafinder

## Overview

The goal of cbsafinder is finding the CBSA (Census Bureau Statistical Area) of the US addresses. 

CBSA's represent one or more counties tied to an urban center of a given size. CBSAs are often used in the retail and real estate industries to help determine the geographic area of a given address.

While a zip code is usually more readily available, they are poor representations of a geographic area they sometimes overlap and there are often many zip codes in a metro area. They were developed solely to deliver mail and not for geographic analysis, unlike CBSAs.  

This package contains no Warby Parker data.  

We wrote an R Package so that you can use CBSAs for your geographic analysis too!


## Installation

Install the development version of the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WarbyParker/cbsafinder", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You'll also need to get a Google API key and enable it to use the Geocoding API - you can find instructions in our Vignette by running: 
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
vignette("get_google_api_key", package = "cbsafinder")
```

## Getting Started

First, start by loading the package. The core function in cbsafinder looks up the CBSA (and a few other bits of handy info) given a U.S. address. So let's say that you want to know the CBSA of the giant Hollywood sign in California. Pass the address as a string to geocode_address() and voila! The Hollywood sign is in Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA.  

```{r example}
library(cbsafinder)
geocode_address("4059 Mount Lee Drive, Hollywood, CA 90068")
```

If you only know part of the address or forget to enter some info, the function still works! 

```{r}
geocode_address("4059 Mount Lee Drive")
```

Just be sure to pass the address as a string (i.e. remember your ""), or the function will fail.  

```{r error = TRUE}
geocode_address(4059 Mount Lee Drive, Hollywood, CA 90068)
```

Also, ``geocode_address()`` takes one address as an argument and no more, so something like this will also fail.  

```{r error = TRUE}
geocode_address(c("4059 Mount Lee Drive, Hollywood, CA 90068", "The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500"))
```

But purrr's map family of functions comes in handy for passing multiple addresses at once. Here we use ``purrr::map_df()`` to return a user friendly output. 

```{r}
my_addresses <- c("4059 Mount Lee Drive, Hollywood, CA 90068", "The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500")

purrr::map_df(my_addresses, ~cbsafinder::geocode_address(.x))
```
